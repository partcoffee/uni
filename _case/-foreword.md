<p class="lead">Hello again. Thank you for looking at my final year portfolio. Grab yourself a cup of tea and sit back. We're about the wrap up this university adventure.</p>

I'm going to miss making these. Showing off my end of semester portfolio has always been a moment of pride and excitement – and this time, even more so. This portfolio has been built on top of my <a target="_blank" href="/">previous portfolio</a>, which has been changed and adapted to the feedback and critique received. It will keep a similar structure to remain clear and easy to navigate.

## Formalities

I still find the foundation behind this portfolio to be important, so please have a <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/uni" target="_blank">peek at the GitHub repository</a> for a greater understanding of how this site functions and how much work went into it. I would encourage you to look at the most recent commits, which will highlight the differences between the previous version and this one.

You can read more about all of the above in the <a href="/final/online-portfolio/">online portfolio section</a>.

See how I work in the <a target="_blank" href="/final/workflow-and-conclusion/">workflow section</a>, download my <a target="_blank" href="#">live CV</a>, and explore how I made my <a target="_blank" href="/final/printed-portfolio">printed portfolio</a>. All photography by me unless otherwise specified.

## Work and university relationship

My initial plan for my second semester was to move back to Winchester and attend lectures as normal. However, luck was on my side and I was offered an extended contract at <a href="http://riktigspor.no" target="_blank">Riktig Spor</a> in Norway – giving me the option to continue working full-time with remote lectures on the side. Whee!

Riktig Spor has given me another great opportunity to learn and further enhance my skillset, adapting to the agency workflow. While this arrangement is stressful, it is also relieving and comforting to know where I will be when I submit my final document this year.

## Acknowledgements

**Riktig Spor** for their trust and investement in me as a developer, and **Svein** in particular for his guidance and help with my printed portfolio.

**Debs Wilson and Paul Wilson**, for their continued trust, support, belief in my abilities and time spent helping me.

**The University of Winchester staff and lecturers** for making this semester possible to complete from Norway.

**Family and friends** for their continued support and kind words.

<!-- <p class="lead">First and foremost, thank you for reading my portfolio. I appreciate it. Secondly, while I adapt products to client needs, requirements and wishes, my personal style is very much influenced by Scandinavian design and outstanding individuals like Erik Spiekermann, Dieter Rams and Andrew Kim.</p>

Adjust the above to suit your needs – make it unique, but build upon the previously made portfolio I think it's very important to keep something similar to the previous thing to convey meaning but keep the changes in mind.
