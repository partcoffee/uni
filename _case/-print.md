<p class="lead">The printed portfolio actually made me reconsider my career path. It's extremely satisfying to have a physical object that you can hold, touch and feel at the end of a long process – and there is actually a finish line, compared to a website which can always be improved in one way or another. Let's break down the process.</p>

<p class="pull pull-left">
	This is my first piece of printed work in years, and I haven't touched the software in five years. This obviously brought challenges of their own, but the primary focus from the very beginning was a solid foundation and idea. As a web developer, how can I show my work in a printed format?
	<span>The portfolio is also available <a href="/../img/final/print.pdf" target="_blank">online</a>.</span>
</p>

For the majority of the jobs I'm interested in, my online presence and portfolio takes the front seat, but I still want the printed portfolio to serve as a conversation-starter. I want to include less "code" and more visual work, highlighting a broader skillset and past experiences.

<div class="div"></div>

## Foundation

I had two different paths to go down for this project – showing everything noteworthy over the past three years or a small selection. The latter sounded more appealing to me, as I wanted the portfolio to reflect the kind of work I wanted to do in the future, rather than everything I have ever done.

I had initial plans of a dedicated section to portrait- and product photography, along with a section for work experience, personal projects and client projects – and while I did enjoy the majority of these projects, they weren't really up to the standard I was aiming for. I also had to make time for photography as I wanted to avoid overused mock-ups for my personal portfolio.

## Photography

I enjoy photography, and it's something I find challenging and rewarding. I wanted to include a fair amount of it in my portfolio to perhaps do more of it in the future. Based on the feedback from my previous semester, I also wanted to document more of my process, so here's a informal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxeXftX5uo4" target="_blank">behind-the-scenes look</a> of one of my sessions, and why I shoot the way I do. I also included a brief look on my post-shoot process:

		</div>
	</div>
	<span>Post-processing photos.</span>
</div>

<div class="div"></div>

My process is still fairly organic, and I'm a strong believer of "happy accidents," or exploring something with potential from merely messing around. I find it healthy to try some different things by the end of a photo shoot or editing process as I might discover a new perspective or look by accident. However, it's always recommended to have a plan before shooting as flying completely blind rarely works out well.

<div class="div"></div>

As for brainstorming the structure, I found myself surprisingly inefficient with a computer, and quickly resorted to pen and paper. I also made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oSMrf6LHZY" target="_blank">brief video update</a> on my process. The physical dimentions was picked from several inspiring design magazines I found at work, and the paper from a selection of samples sent by the printing firm.

I had initial plans of going with another idea, and simply print it as a 12 page A5 brochure. I even made a <a href="/../img/final/prototype.jpg" target="_blank">prototype</a>, but quickly decided against it as it felt cheap and as if I didn't want to take pride in my work.

It's also worth mentioning the primary challenge of working in print – and that is the delayed results. I'm used to a web environment, where changes are made instantly and I can see how it looks in a browser within seconds. With print, it might not turn out the way you had hoped, and your only way to correct that is to have it re-printed. This seems obvious, but it's a different way of working for me, and made test-prints along the way a crucial part of the process.

## Design and self-branding

This one was tricky for me. I'm not a freelance designer or developer, and therefore not looking to brand myself as such. A personal logo may often imply this, and while it could have been a shortcut to consistent self-branding, I believe it would also give the wrong impression. With that in mind, I had to think of different ways to convey a consistent style throughout my online- and printed portfolio, and spent a significant amount of time making sure it still felt "Magnus."

I wanted something modern, and using subtle shades of white and black, I let the photography and typography speak for me – with no need for flourishes or excessive distracting elements. I believe I achieved my goal by keeping this "Muji"-philosophy of "no design" throughout the process, and I hope it's still recognisable as a "Magnus" product.

## Production

After writing all my text and shooting all the necessary pictures, I had to assemble everything. This was initially prototyped in low resolution Photoshop file, and later made production-ready in InDesign – using different weights of Work Sans for a timeless typographic impression. I would have liked to use Proxima Nova, but after test-printing, it did not work as well as it does on a screen-based medium. The final piece was printed as a 21cm x 27.5cm portfolio, on 32x 170g pages with a 300g front- and back page. You can see the final finished piece below or (hopefully) on your desk right now.

## Closing thoughts

I'm generally very pleased with the outcome, it looks clean and feels professional to the touch, and showcases the type of work I want to do in the future; simple solutions to complex problems.

<p class="pull">If I were to continue working on this project, or ever do a similar project again, I would like to explore different types of paper and further enhance the colour profile. I noticed a few under-exposed pictures (compared to how I wanted them to look), which could have been improved given more experience with the print medium. As for the paper, I would have liked to try a matte option.<span>The portfolio can also be seen as a <a href="/../img/final/print.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a></span></p>

Ultimately, I'm extremely excited to have a physical product to hold in my hands at this point, and I hope it's able to showcase the amount of work and effort it took to finally get there. I would also like to show my gratitude for my work placement and their continous advice and help along the way.
