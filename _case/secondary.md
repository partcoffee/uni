<p class="lead">I never have enough time to do everything I want to do throughout the day, and when university and work is battling for my attention, I simply had to put all my other projects on hold.</p>

This is simply a list of projects I have been working on, in no particular order. They may not be as polished or well thought out as everything else, but I have included them anyway in order to highlight their existence. The vast majority of this is unfinished and should be treated as such.

I feel like I should include everything in this portfolio, but these projects weren't necessarily directly related to my course. Thus, they act as bonus content to the portfolio.
