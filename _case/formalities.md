"unused web projects" or "photos that didn't make the cut".</p>

* Mention the year briefly

<p class="lead">First and foremost, thank you for reading my portfolio. I appreciate it. Secondly, while I adapt products to client needs, requirements and wishes, my personal style is very much influenced by Scandinavian design and outstanding individuals like Erik Spiekermann, Dieter Rams and Andrew Kim.</p>

<p class="lead">They, along with great magazines like Offscreen and Monocle, inspire me, and while I may not be anywhere near their level of perfection just yet, they encourage me to work hard.</p>

## Preface

<p class="pull">
	As a preface to this semester, I'd like to mention my <a href="http://magnusskare.science/uni/" target="_blank">previous portfolio</a>. While I believe it did manage to showcase my work in a professional manner, I have to agree with the feedback I received &mdash; it was impenetrable. The sheer volume of work came across as overwhelming, mainly due to my subjective fear of seeming shallow. I wanted to show depth, but completely disregarded the end user (you) in the process.
	<span class="entry">For reference: the <a href="http://magnusskare.science/uni/" target="_blank">previous portfolio</a>, hosted on a seperate web server</span>
</p>

I hope to include a vast amount of work this year as well, but hopefully keep brevity in mind this time. I'd also like to clarify that I can not show every single project from my work placement, due to contracts and work agreements.

Download my <a href="#">NLT document</a> and <a target="_blank" href="../img/formalities/cv.pdf">live CV</a>.

And please <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/uni" target="_blank">explore the GitHub repository</a> behind this website as well, as it is a key part of what I am submitting. This accompanies the <a href="/portfolio">portfolio case study</a> and is mainly referring to the comments in the <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/uni/tree/master/_sass" target="_blank">Sass folder</a>, <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/uni/tree/master/css" target="_blank">main Sass file</a> and <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/uni/blob/master/js/main.js" target="_blank">main JavaScript file</a>.

## Juggling work and university

I am extremely grateful for the opportunity given to me by the University of Winchester and my current workplace, letting me work full-time alongside my studies. It has been stressful, certainly, but the amount of knowledge I have acquired through this arrangement would have taken me significantly longer to gather on my own from inside my comfort zone.

To clarify, I have been working for Riktig Spor as of September 1st, and tuning into lectures over Skype on a weekly basis. This has given me weekends and afternoons to work on university projects. This is admittedly less time than last year, as I had dedicated days to university work, rather than hours. However, I would argue that with less time spent in lectures, fewer deadlines on a week-by-week basis, and a neglectable amount of group work, I should have enough time to focus on my individual work and deadlines.

## Secondary work

I also have a fair amount of unfinished or unrelated (to the university) projects. I simply ran out of time to do other projects this year, but I have included bits and pieces anyway. They may not be as polished or well thought out as everything else, but I have included them <a href="/secondary">in this portfolio</a> to emphasise their existence anyway.
