## Work placement thoughts

<p class="pull">First and foremost, I am really thankful for the opportunity given to me by Riktig Spor and the University of Winchester for letting me work in Norway while I study. I thoroughly enjoyed working here, and in fact, it doesn't really feel like work just yet – because I am simply having fun doing it.<span>Read my <a href="/riktigspor">thoughts on working for Riktig Spor</a> for context</span></p>

I covered several projects, forcing me to consider every aspect of the task. This includes cost, design, development, time management and delivery. I had hopes of improving my skills in client management, business strategies and the modern web development workflow – and I believe I did.

From here, I'd like to further develop my workflow and pick up better practises for developing maintainable web products.

## Workflow reflection

<!-- * Is it optimal
* Skills obtained, currently efficient in the following: PHP, Git etc. -->

My workflow is not optimal just yet, but it is satisfactory for now, while I am the only developer on the team. This is something I intend to work on to secure a better future for new members of the team.

From this semester I worked with the following technologies and languages

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li class="entry">HTML</li>
	<li class="entry">HTML preprocessors</li>
	<li class="entry">CSS</li>
	<li class="entry">CSS preprocessors</li>
	<li class="entry">CSS frameworks</li>
	<li class="entry">JavaScript</li>
	<li class="entry">JavaScript frameworks</li>
	<li class="entry">Markdown</li>
	<li class="entry">YAML data in Jekyll</li>
	<li class="entry">Liquid templating</li>
	<li class="entry">Git and version-control</li>
	<li class="entry">Build tools (Gulp)</li>
	<li class="entry">Static site generators</li>
	<li class="entry">Content management systems (Wordpress)</li>
	<li class="entry">PHP</li>
	<li class="entry">Server- and domain configurations</li>
	<li class="entry">SSH and safe uploading</li>
	<li class="entry">SEO and social media integration</li>
	<li class="entry">Web performance</li>
	<li class="entry">Web accessibility</li>
</ul>

and the software to manage it

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li class="entry">Photoshop</li>
	<li class="entry">Illustrator</li>
	<li class="entry">InDesign</li>
	<li class="entry">Lightroom</li>
	<li class="entry">Final Cut Pro</li>
	<li class="entry">Sublime Text or other text-editors with Emmet</li>
	<li class="entry">MAMP</li>
	<li class="entry">Terminal (command line)</li>
</ul>

## Secondary work

My side projects are usually initiated by boredom or lacking challenges. This has not been the case since I started working full-time and therefore the majority of my side projects have been put on hold for now.

My motivation used to be a richer portfolio, but after landing a job I enjoy, my personal portfolio has not been a high priority. I am sure my lecturers and professors can relate to this. Even people lecturing me on the importance of a portfolio can not find the time to update their own after landing a job they like.

I feel this is justified, but I do intend to pick up more side-projects and update my personal public portfolio as I finish university.

## Portfolio reflections

The purpose of this website is to show my work in a reflective manner, and I believe I achieved that goal by assigning work to different categories. I avoided bloat by having separate sections for development/processes, reflections and final outcomes – and even though I feel there is a lot of content on this website, I also think it is needed in order to show depth.

The portfolio is based upon tutor feedback from my previous semester, which in return was based on feedback from the semester before that. The site was developed from scratch, which in itself should demonstrate my abilities. The projects are laid out according to the assessment sheet on the topic of breadth and depth, and the code is commented to be a case-study in itself.

Possible improvements include critical CSS, CDN and aggressive content-caching. Given the timeframe and purpose of the site however, I am very happy with the outcome, and believe the improvements mentioned to be important, but of low priority.

## Checking boxes

I believe I covered everything this semester to the best of my abilities, given my situation and standing contracts.

I included a <a href="/projects">a brief overview of the placement projects and outcomes</a>, with a general outline of <a href="/workflow-and-sketchbook">the process behind it and how I work</a>. The <a href="/workflow-and-sketchbook">workflow-section</a> should show evidence of research undertaking, with specific references to inspiration, books, websites and other publications – while also explaining as much of the process of idea to final outcome as possible.

My project is <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/uni" target="_blank">available on GitHub, with commented code</a> to show depth and purpose of every single line of code. As I mainly work with code, I this to be a case-study of its own. I also made <a href="vimeo.com/147452061" target="_blank">my sketchbook</a> available in HD to emphasise the process and initial stages of a project.

The progression of ideas can mainly be seen in my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio case study</a>, as contracts prevent me from sharing too many details. However, I feel the <a href="/workflow-and-sketchbook/#development">development section of the workflow page</a> applies to the majority of my projects. The portfolio case study along with the <a href="/secondary">secondary work page</a> also outlines alternative approaches, and why they were or weren't chosen.

Finally, key influeces and inspiration are both emphasised in my <a href="/workflow-and-sketchbook/#inspiration-and-design-research">workflow section</a>.

## Final thoughts

I am eager to start my career in web development, and this has certainly given me a good start. Looking back, I am very pleased with my decision of working full-time and the uni/work arrangement agreed upon.

For my second semester, which is not intended for work placement as a module, I may have to follow a strict one-on-one tutorial schedule to make sure I am not falling behind.

I am also very pleased with the outcome of all my projects this semester – at university and at work. I do, however, hope to improve in both fields over the next semester, and offer my best portfolio yet in May 2016.
