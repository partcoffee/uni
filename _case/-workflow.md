<p class="lead">I never really expected my second semester to be in Norway, but the pieces fell into place, and suddenly I'm 6 months my job as a full stack developer. To make this semester work, I had to accept the fact that free time would have to wait until after my deadlines – and I had a brief taste of that by the end of the first semester.</p>

I'm probably repeating myself now, but I follow the same priority-list as before, outlining work-related tasks every monday of the week – and my week is looking almost identical to my first semester. I found myself debating this particular article a lot, as my workflow has barely changed from my <a href="/workflow-and-sketchbook/">previous semester</a> – I believe it's worth reading if you haven't already.

## What's new

<p class="pull pull-left">I thought I'd be useful to talk about what's changed instead of repeating myself. I like learning, and I have recently been given the "top of the iceberg" version of everything within Digital Marketing through Google's <a href="http://www.yourprimer.com/" target="_blank">Primer</a> application. This has given me valuable insight on advertising, content, measurement and strategy and has become avaluable asset to my background research on any given field.<span>There is something special about the look and smell of a well designed magazine.</span></p>

As an addition to the previously mentioned <a href="/workflow-and-sketchbook/#inspiration-and-design-research">sources of inspiration</a>, the way <a href="http://www.muji.com/" target="_blank">Muji</a> approaches design made me re-think everything. Muji is known for "no design," or a completely honest approach to products. There's rarely any flourishes or "useless" features, but simply pure and honest design – without making it ugly. The balance is remarkable, and their take on photography is outstanding – a great source of inspiration in my opinion, alongside the following, to name a few:

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>Aftenposten (magazine)</li>
	<li>Minimally Minimal (web)</li>

I also mentioned architecture on the front-page, which has become a calming source of inspiration and peace for me. Individuals like Arne Jacobsen and the modern Japanese/Scandinavian architectural landscape comes to mind, and I even made a secret board on Pinterest to keep everything in one place. I made it <a href="https://no.pinterest.com/magnusskare/architecture-interior/" target="_blank">temporarily public</a> for your convenience.

## Teaching

I have also been teaching a lot more this semester than before – not only in a work setting, but also through a significant amount of hours on a particular origiami-application for a fellow student. This covered prototypes, debugging, answering domain and server questions, along with general development queries. I shared prototypes through various online code editors along with file-sharing and screen sharing. For the latter I used <a href="https://appear.in/" target="_blank">appear.in</a> to give a brief one-on-one tutorial on how to run a local server (Python) and navigate the command line.

## Sketchbook and videos

A different approach to my previous semester would be the addition of video content to explain my thoughts, ideas and highlight the process in a honest and unfiltered way. I made a short video to highlight some thoughts on my sketchbook and workflow, and included all the other VLOGs below. In other words: the process is most definitely still there, but budget and tight deadlines might affect the quality of process documentation. I also went ahead and verified my YouTube account to support custom thumbnails – which gives me more control over how they look as embedded videos on this site.

While my sketchbook contains a fair amount of notes, I also use <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> efficiently. Slack is a messaging app, and extremely well built for teams and collaboration. Formatting is effecient as it supports markdown, and file sharing is quick and effortless. As you can see below, I make lists and cross them off as tasks are completed. We also have specific channels for specific projects, to keep everything in one place (passwords, usernames, and a track record of how we went from A to B).

I introducing the team to Slack in my previous semester, but I only recently had the whole team working through it. It's certainly more effecient than emails and post-it notes for sending messages and keeping track, and I think the entire team has seen the benefits of this when we have to juggle several projects at once.

The use of Slack also helped me communicate prototypes and alternative approaches prior to developing it on a live website. For this, I used <a href="http://codepen.io/" target="_blank">Codepen</a>.

## Conclusion

My workflow is still very organic, but not as thorough as I'd like it to be. Ideally, I would spend hours or even days to develop a brand new concept for a website – prototyping ideas and polishing features. However, this would merely apply to a handful of clients, and the vast majority can not afford to pay for that kind of process and amount of work. This is a shame, but it's also reality.

In terms of time management, Riktig Spor has been flexible, giving me the opportunity to travel to the UK when needed, and working on university-related assignments when I wanted to. In return, that let me direct my attention to work when I'm actually working, without drifting over to a portfolio I should be making.
