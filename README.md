# Uni portfolio

This is my university portfolio for Q1/Q2 of 2016, an improved version of the 2015-build. The site is built from scratch with Jekyll for speed and performance.

For more information on Jekyll, I'd encourage reading their documentation, but the essence of it is a really good static site generator â€“ saving me and other developers hours of work.

## Folders explained

* **_case** contains case studies
* **_data** contains data for loops for easy maintainability
* **_includes** holds reusable code like header.html, footer.html etc.
* **_layouts** contains layouts like article pages, homepage, compression page etc.
* **_sass** contains Sass-files that we import to our main CSS file
* **_site** is the final output generated by Jekyll
* **css** contains our main Sass-file
* **img** contains images and subfolders for every page
* **img/final** and **img/bit** contains images exclusive to Q1/Q2 of 2016
