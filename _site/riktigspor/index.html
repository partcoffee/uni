I work five days a week, covering a range of clients &mdash; from small websites to larger corporate ones. This article aims to cover the majority of these, but leaves out a few for contract reasons.<span>See all the <a href="/projects">projects</a> I contributed to</span></p> <p>As a general preface to this section, I should mention my responsibilities. I am admittedly still a student, and with that I am still learning — which is also the ultimate goal of this work placement. However, I am the primary web developer at this company, and thus I quickly took on the responsibility of hosting, developing and designing websites and web applications. I also cover photography at times, and the role of the web advisor for clients.</p> <p>See all the <a href="/projects">projects</a> I contributed to.</p> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="the-experience">The experience</h2> <p>I quickly had to widen my comfort zone in order to work efficiently. While I am comfortable developing relatively static sites, dynamic and editable content is a new world to me. Necessary to meet client needs, certainly, but undiscovered lands to me nonetheless.</p> <p>The current plan of action is to expand our web horizon, where I play a key role. I hope I can continue to improve in order to make us the very best at this in Northern Norway.</p> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="words-from-the-general-manager">Words from the general manager</h2> <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

As the lone developer in a team of mainly designers, I feel valuable – which is incredibly heartwarming, as web development has been a passion for years now. Sure, I am still learning new things, but it is relieving to have all those late nights learning JavaScript and CSS pay off.</p> <p>The experience of working here so far has been great, and while I certainly do make mistakes on a regular basis, I learn from it and adapt – and they let me, which I believe is beneficial for both parties.</p> <p>I have experienced great launch-events and undertaken small, medium and large-scale websites. I also had to explore the server-side aspect of the web, along with dymaic programming languages like PHP – both of which being fairly new to me. I hope to become more confident as time passes, but I will hopefully never stop learning for that reason.</p> <p>See all my <a href="/projects">projects</a> for Riktig Spor.</p> <div class="div"></div> <!-- * Lofoten Links * Riktig Spor web * Opplyst * MKK * Bryggerikvartalet * Bodø Havn * Riktig Spor template, concept development * Glea * Bodø i Vinden * Bodø 2016 - photography * General photography --> <p class="mid"> <a href="/" class="button shift"> <svg class="icon icon-chevron-thin-left"> <use xlink:href="#icon-chevron-thin-left"></use> </svg> Back to home </a> </p> </article> <footer class="footer"> <ul class="footer-list"> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://twitter.com/MagnusSkare">Twitter</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://dribbble.com/PartCoffee/">Dribbble</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/">GithHub</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://instagram.com/magnusskare/">Instagram</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="/">Powered by coffee and love</a> </li> </ul> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src='/js/main.js'></script> <!--[if lt IE 9]> <style>#ie-upgrade{background:#FFF;bottom:0;display:table;height:100%;left:0;position:fixed;right:0;top:0;width:100%;z-index:9000;}#ie-only{margin-bottom: 0;}.ie-message{display:table-cell;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;padding: 0 20%;}.ie-message p{max-width:500px;margin:20px auto 30px;}#ie-upgrade .button{background:#555;color:#FFF;padding:14px 28px 12px;}</style> <div id="ie-upgrade"> <div class="ie-message"> <h1>Hello Internet Explorer user</h1> <p>Your current Internet browser is being outphased, and is too old to display this page correctly.
