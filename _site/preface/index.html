I appreciate it. Secondly, while I adapt products to client needs, requirements and wishes, my personal style is very much influenced by Scandinavian design and outstanding individuals like Erik Spiekermann, Dieter Rams and Andrew Kim.</p> <p class="lead">They, along with great magazines like Offscreen and Monocle, inspire me, and while I may not be anywhere near their level of perfection just yet, they encourage me to work hard.</p> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="formalities">Formalities</h2> <p class="pull"> As a preface to this semester, I'd like to mention my <a href="http://magnusskare.science/uni/" target="_blank">previous portfolio</a>. While I believe it did manage to showcase my work in a professional manner, I have to agree with the feedback I received &mdash; it was impenetrable. The sheer volume of work came across as overwhelming, mainly due to my subjective fear of seeming shallow. I wanted to show depth, but completely disregarded the end user (you) in the process. <span class="entry">For reference: the <a href="http://magnusskare.science/uni/" target="_blank">previous portfolio</a>, hosted on a separate web server</span> </p> <p>I hope to include a vast amount of work this year as well, but hopefully with brevity in mind this time – especially as there might be more work to show this semester. I’d also like to clarify that I can not show every single project from my work placement, due to contracts and work agreements.</p> <p>Please <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/uni" target="_blank">explore the GitHub repository</a> behind this website as well, as it is a key part of what I am submitting. This accompanies the <a href="/portfolio">portfolio case study</a> and is mainly referring to the comments in the <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/uni/tree/master/_sass" target="_blank">Sass folder</a>, <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/uni/blob/master/css/main.scss" target="_blank">main Sass file</a> and <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/uni/blob/master/js/main.js" target="_blank">main JavaScript file</a>.</p> <p>You can also reference <a href="https://vimeo.com/147452061" target="_blank">my sketchbook</a> at any given time.</p> <p>Download my <a href="#">NLT document</a>, <a target="_blank" href="../img/formalities/cv.pdf">live CV</a> and <a href="#">professional portfolio</a>.</p> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="juggling-work-and-university">Juggling work and university</h2> <p>I am extremely grateful for the opportunity given to me by the University of Winchester and my current workplace, letting me work full-time alongside my studies. It has been stressful, certainly, but the amount of knowledge I have acquired through this arrangement would have taken me significantly longer to gather on my own from inside my comfort zone.</p> <p>To clarify, I have been working for Riktig Spor as of September 1st, and tuning into lectures over Skype on a weekly basis. This has given me weekends and afternoons to work on university projects. This is admittedly less time than last year, as I had dedicated days to university work, rather than hours. However, I would argue that with less time spent in lectures, fewer deadlines on a week-by-week basis, and a neglectable amount of group work, I should have enough time to focus on my individual work and deadlines.</p> <div class="div"></div> <img src="../img/workflow/layout.jpg" alt="Print layout"> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="what-i-hope-to-improve-upon">What I hope to improve upon</h2> <ul class="skill-list"> <li class="entry">Client management</li> <li class="entry">Content management systems</li> <li class="entry">Web development</li> <li class="entry">Build systems</li> <li class="entry">Design critiques</li> <li class="entry">Photography</li> <li class="entry">Project management</li> <li class="entry">Business strategies and cost estimates</li> </ul> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="secondary-work">Secondary work</h2> <p>I also have a fair amount of unfinished or unrelated (to the university) projects.
