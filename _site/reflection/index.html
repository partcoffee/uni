I thoroughly enjoyed working here, and in fact, it doesn't really feel like work just yet – because I am simply having fun doing it.<span>Read my <a href="/riktigspor">thoughts on working for Riktig Spor</a> for context</span></p> <p>I covered several projects, forcing me to consider every aspect of the task. This includes cost, design, development, time management and delivery. I had hopes of improving my skills in client management, business strategies and the modern web development workflow – and I believe I did.</p> <p>From here, I’d like to further develop my workflow and pick up better practises for developing maintainable web products.</p> <div class="div"></div> <img src="../img/workflow/layout.jpg" alt="Sketchbook"> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="workflow-reflection">Workflow reflection</h2> <!-- * Is it optimal * Skills obtained, currently efficient in the following: PHP, Git etc. --> <p>My workflow is not optimal just yet, but it is satisfactory for now, while I am the only developer on the team. This is something I intend to work on to secure a better future for new members of the team.</p> <p>From this semester I experienced the following technologies and languages</p> <ul class="skill-list"> <li>HTML</li> <li>HTML preprocessors</li> <li>CSS</li> <li>CSS preprocessors</li> <li>CSS frameworks</li> <li>JavaScript</li> <li>JavaScript frameworks</li> <li>Markdown</li> <li>YAML data in Jekyll</li> <li>Liquid templating</li> <li>Git and version-control</li> <li>Build tools (Gulp)</li> <li>Static site generators</li> <li>Content management systems (Wordpress)</li> <li>PHP</li> <li>Server- and domain configurations</li> <li>SSH and safe uploading</li> <li>SEO and social media integration</li> <li>Web performance</li> <li>Web accessibility</li> </ul> <p>and the software to manage it</p> <ul class="skill-list"> <li>Photoshop</li> <li>Illustrator</li> <li>InDesign</li> <li>Lightroom</li> <li>Final Cut Pro</li> <li>Sublime Text or other text-editors with Emmet</li> <li>MAMP</li> <li>Terminal (command line)</li> </ul> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="secondary-work">Secondary work</h2> <p>My side projects are usually initiated by boredom or lacking challenges. This has not been the case since I started working full-time and therefore the majority of my side projects have been put on hold for now.</p> <p>My motivation used to be a richer portfolio, but after landing a job I enjoy, my personal portfolio has not been a high priority. I am sure my lecturers and professors can relate to this. Even people lecturing me on the importance of a portfolio can not find the time to update their own after landing a job they like.</p> <p>I feel this is justified, but I do intend to pick up more side-projects and update my personal public portfolio as I finish university.</p> <div class="div"></div> <img src="../img/portfolio/img1.jpg" alt="Personal portfolio"> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="portfolio-reflections">Portfolio reflections</h2> <p>The purpose of this website is to show my work in a reflective manner, and I believe I achieved that goal by assigning work to different categories. I avoided bloat by having separate sections for development/processes, reflections and final outcomes – and even though I feel there is a lot of content on this website, I also think it is needed in order to show depth.</p> <p>The portfolio is based upon tutor feedback from my previous semester, which in return was based on feedback from the semester before that. The site was developed from scratch, which in itself should demonstrate my abilities. The projects are laid out according to the assessment sheet on the topic of breadth and depth, and the code is commented to be a case-study in itself.</p> <p>Possible improvements include critical CSS, CDN and aggressive content-caching. Given the timeframe and purpose of the site however, I am very happy with the outcome, and believe the improvements mentioned to be important, but of low priority.</p> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2> <p>I am eager to start my career in web development, and this has certainly given me a good start. Looking back, I am very pleased with my decision of working full-time and the uni/work arrangement agreed upon.</p> <p>For my second semester, which is not intended for work placement as a module, I may have to follow a strict one-on-one tutorial schedule to make sure I am not falling behind.</p> <p>I am also very pleased with the outcome of all my projects this semester – at university and at work. I do, however, hope to improve in both fields over the next semester, and offer my best portfolio yet in May 2016.</p> <div class="div"></div> <p class="mid"> <a href="/" class="button shift"> <svg class="icon icon-chevron-thin-left"> <use xlink:href="#icon-chevron-thin-left"></use> </svg> Back to home </a> </p> </article> <footer class="footer"> <ul class="footer-list"> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://twitter.com/MagnusSkare">Twitter</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://dribbble.com/PartCoffee/">Dribbble</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/">GithHub</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://instagram.com/magnusskare/">Instagram</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="/">Powered by coffee and love</a> </li> </ul> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src='/js/main.js'></script> <!--[if lt IE 9]> <style>#ie-upgrade{background:#FFF;bottom:0;display:table;height:100%;left:0;position:fixed;right:0;top:0;width:100%;z-index:9000;}#ie-only{margin-bottom: 0;}.ie-message{display:table-cell;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;padding: 0 20%;}.ie-message p{max-width:500px;margin:20px auto 30px;}#ie-upgrade .button{background:#555;color:#FFF;padding:14px 28px 12px;}</style> <div id="ie-upgrade"> <div class="ie-message"> <h1>Hello Internet Explorer user</h1> <p>Your current Internet browser is being outphased, and is too old to display this page correctly.
