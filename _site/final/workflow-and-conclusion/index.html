To make this semester work, I had to accept the fact that free time would have to wait until after my deadlines – and I had a brief taste of that by the end of the first semester.</p> <p>I’m probably repeating myself now, but I follow the same priority-list as before, outlining work-related tasks every monday of the week – and my week is looking almost identical to my first semester. I found myself debating this particular article a lot, as my workflow has barely changed from my <a href="/workflow-and-sketchbook/">previous semester</a> – I believe it’s worth reading if you haven’t already.</p> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="whats-new">What’s new</h2> <p class="pull pull-left">I thought I'd be useful to talk about what's changed instead of repeating myself. I like learning, and I have recently been given the "top of the iceberg" version of everything within Digital Marketing through Google's <a href="http://www.yourprimer.com/" target="_blank">Primer</a> application. This has given me valuable insight on advertising, content, measurement and strategy and has become avaluable asset to my background research on any given field.<span>There is something special about the look and smell of a well designed magazine.</span></p> <p>As an addition to the previously mentioned <a href="/workflow-and-sketchbook/#inspiration-and-design-research">sources of inspiration</a>, the way <a href="http://www.muji.com/" target="_blank">Muji</a> approaches design made me re-think everything. Muji is known for “no design,” or a completely honest approach to products. There’s rarely any flourishes or “useless” features, but simply pure and honest design – without making it ugly. The balance is remarkable, and their take on photography is outstanding – a great source of inspiration in my opinion, alongside the following, to name a few:</p> <div class="div"></div> <ul class="skill-list"> <li>Aftenposten (magazine)</li> <li>Minimally Minimal (web)</li> <li>Kinfolk (web and printed)</li> <li>Monocle (web and printed)</li> <li>Cereal (web and printed)</li> <li>Medium (web)</li> <li>A-magasinet (web and printed)</li> <li>Residence (book)</li> <li>Squarespace (web)</li> <li>Offscreen (web and printed)</li> <li>Dribbble (web)</li> <li>Siteinspire (web)</li> <li>Designspiration (web)</li> <li>MindSparkle Magazine (web)</li> </ul> <div class="div"></div> <div class="caption mid"> <div class="contain"> <img src="/../img/final/blur-lq.jpg" data-src="/../img/final/blur.jpg" alt="Workflow" class="lazy lazyload"> </div> <span>Our local library is a great source of inspiration for me, with a range of magazines I never would have seen otherwise.</span> </div> <div class="div"></div> <p>I also mentioned architecture on the front-page, which has become a calming source of inspiration and peace for me. Individuals like Arne Jacobsen and the modern Japanese/Scandinavian architectural landscape comes to mind, and I even made a secret board on Pinterest to keep everything in one place. I made it <a href="https://no.pinterest.com/magnusskare/architecture-interior/" target="_blank">temporarily public</a> for your convenience.</p> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2> <p>I have also been teaching a lot more this semester than before – not only in a work setting, but also through a significant amount of hours on a particular origiami-application for a fellow student. This covered prototypes, debugging, answering domain and server questions, along with general development queries. I shared prototypes through various online code editors along with file-sharing and screen sharing. For the latter I used <a href="https://appear.in/" target="_blank">appear.in</a> to give a brief one-on-one tutorial on how to run a local server (Python) and navigate the command line.</p> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="sketchbook-and-videos">Sketchbook and videos</h2> <p>A different approach to my previous semester would be the addition of video content to explain my thoughts, ideas and highlight the process in a honest and unfiltered way. I made a short video to highlight some thoughts on my sketchbook and workflow, and included all the other VLOGs below. In other words: the process is most definitely still there, but budget and tight deadlines might affect the quality of process documentation. I also went ahead and verified my YouTube account to support custom thumbnails – which gives me more control over how they look as embedded videos on this site.</p> <div class="div"></div> <div class="contain"> <div class="article-video fade wait" id="video"> <iframe width="1280" height="720" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0j2uvW9SjWs?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;color=white" allowfullscreen="" class="lazy lazyload"></iframe> </div> </div> <div class="div"></div> <ul class="skill-list"> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxeXftX5uo4" target="_blank">Photography</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oSMrf6LHZY" target="_blank">Editing (Photography)</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oSMrf6LHZY" target="_blank">Printed Portfolio</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_Pn-1HegHI" target="_blank">Feedback Review</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oInLchLMLs" target="_blank">LazyLoading (demo)</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTWdSSj4Oc0" target="_blank">Layout issue (demo)</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pmHa1i8Gig" target="_blank">Work update (1/3)</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7br_yy62--0" target="_blank">Work update (2/3)</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0H_heO6eaA" target="_blank">Work update (3/3)</a></li> </ul> <div class="div"></div> <p>While my sketchbook contains a fair amount of notes, I also use <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a> efficiently. Slack is a messaging app, and extremely well built for teams and collaboration. Formatting is effecient as it supports markdown, and file sharing is quick and effortless. As you can see below, I make lists and cross them off as tasks are completed. We also have specific channels for specific projects, to keep everything in one place (passwords, usernames, and a track record of how we went from A to B).</p> <p>I introducing the team to Slack in my previous semester, but I only recently had the whole team working through it. It’s certainly more effecient than emails and post-it notes for sending messages and keeping track, and I think the entire team has seen the benefits of this when we have to juggle several projects at once.</p> <p>The use of Slack also helped me communicate prototypes and alternative approaches prior to developing it on a live website. For this, I used <a href="http://codepen.io/" target="_blank">Codepen</a>.</p> <div class="div"></div> <div class="caption mid"> <div class="contain"> <img src="/../img/final/slack-lq.png" data-src="/../img/final/slack.png" alt="Workflow" class="lazy lazyload fade wait"> </div> <span></span> </div> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>My workflow is still very organic, but not as thorough as I’d like it to be. Ideally, I would spend hours or even days to develop a brand new concept for a website – prototyping ideas and polishing features. However, this would merely apply to a handful of clients, and the vast majority can not afford to pay for that kind of process and amount of work. This is a shame, but it’s also reality.</p> <p>In terms of time management, Riktig Spor has been flexible, giving me the opportunity to travel to the UK when needed, and working on university-related assignments when I wanted to. In return, that let me direct my attention to work when I’m actually working, without drifting over to a portfolio I should be making.</p> <p class="mid"> <a href="/final" class="button shift"> <svg class="icon icon-chevron-thin-left"> <use xlink:href="#icon-chevron-thin-left"></use> </svg> Back to home </a> </p> </article> <footer class="footer"> <ul class="footer-list"> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://twitter.com/MagnusSkare" target="_blank">Twitter</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://dribbble.com/PartCoffee/" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/" target="_blank">GithHub</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://instagram.com/magnusskare/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/uni/" target="_blank">Powered by coffee and love</a> </li> </ul> </footer> <script src='https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js'></script> <script src='/js/main.js'></script> </div> <!-- Adds a warning-message for IE9 and below to encourage the user of modern browsers --> <!--[if lt IE 9]> <style>#ie-upgrade{background:#FFF;bottom:0;display:table;height:100%;left:0;position:fixed;right:0;top:0;width:100%;z-index:9000;}#ie-only{margin-bottom: 0;}.ie-message{display:table-cell;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;padding: 0 20%;}.ie-message p{max-width:500px;margin:20px auto 30px;}#ie-upgrade .btn{display:inline-block;background:#555;color:#FFF;padding:9px 20px 8px;font-family:'proxima-nova','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;}</style> <div id="ie-upgrade"> <div class="ie-message"> <h1>Hello Internet Explorer user</h1> <p>Your current Internet browser is being outphased, and is too old to display this page correctly.
