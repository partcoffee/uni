It's extremely satisfying to have a physical object that you can hold, touch and feel at the end of a long process – and there is actually a finish line, compared to a website which can always be improved in one way or another. Let's break down the process.</p> <p class="pull pull-left"> This is my first piece of printed work in years, and I haven't touched the software in five years. This obviously brought challenges of their own, but the primary focus from the very beginning was a solid foundation and idea. As a web developer, how can I show my work in a printed format? <span>The portfolio is also available <a href="/../img/final/print.pdf" target="_blank">online</a>.</span> </p> <p>For the majority of the jobs I’m interested in, my online presence and portfolio takes the front seat, but I still want the printed portfolio to serve as a conversation-starter. I want to include less “code” and more visual work, highlighting a broader skillset and past experiences.</p> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="foundation">Foundation</h2> <p>I had two different paths to go down for this project – showing everything noteworthy over the past three years or a small selection. The latter sounded more appealing to me, as I wanted the portfolio to reflect the kind of work I wanted to do in the future, rather than everything I have ever done.</p> <p>I had initial plans of a dedicated section to portrait- and product photography, along with a section for work experience, personal projects and client projects – and while I did enjoy the majority of these projects, they weren’t really up to the standard I was aiming for. I also had to make time for photography as I wanted to avoid overused mock-ups for my personal portfolio.</p> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="photography">Photography</h2> <p>I enjoy photography, and it’s something I find challenging and rewarding. I wanted to include a fair amount of it in my portfolio to perhaps do more of it in the future. Based on the feedback from my previous semester, I also wanted to document more of my process, so here’s a informal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxeXftX5uo4" target="_blank">behind-the-scenes look</a> of one of my sessions, and why I shoot the way I do. I also included a brief look on my post-shoot process:</p> <div class="div"></div> <div class="caption mid"> <div class="contain black"> <div class="article-video fade wait" id="video"> <iframe width="1280" height="720" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SsQ7gymVSn4?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;color=white" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" class="lazy lazyload"></iframe> </div> </div> <span>Post-processing photos.</span> </div> <div class="div"></div> <p>My process is still fairly organic, and I’m a strong believer of “happy accidents,” or exploring something with potential from merely messing around. I find it healthy to try some different things by the end of a photo shoot or editing process as I might discover a new perspective or look by accident. However, it’s always recommended to have a plan before shooting as flying completely blind rarely works out well.</p> <div class="div"></div> <div class="caption mid"> <div class="contain black"> <img src="/../img/final/text-lq.png" data-src="/../img/final/text.png" alt="My university portfolio" class="fade wait lazy lazyload"> </div> <span>I made a rough outline of the copy before deciding upon what projects to include.</span> </div> <div class="div"></div> <p>As for brainstorming the structure, I found myself surprisingly inefficient with a computer, and quickly resorted to pen and paper. I also made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oSMrf6LHZY" target="_blank">brief video update</a> on my process. The physical dimentions was picked from several inspiring design magazines I found at work, and the paper from a selection of samples sent by the printing firm.</p> <p>I had initial plans of going with another idea, and simply print it as a 12 page A5 brochure. I even made a <a href="/../img/final/prototype.jpg" target="_blank">prototype</a>, but quickly decided against it as it felt cheap and as if I didn’t want to take pride in my work.</p> <p>It’s also worth mentioning the primary challenge of working in print – and that is the delayed results. I’m used to a web environment, where changes are made instantly and I can see how it looks in a browser within seconds. With print, it might not turn out the way you had hoped, and your only way to correct that is to have it re-printed. This seems obvious, but it’s a different way of working for me, and made test-prints along the way a crucial part of the process.</p> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="production">Production</h2> <p>After writing all my text and shooting all the necessary pictures, I had to assemble everything. This was initially prototyped in low resolution Photoshop file, and later made production-ready in InDesign – using different weights of Work Sans for a timeless typographic impression. The final piece was printed as a 21cm x 27.5cm portfolio, on 32x 170g pages with a 300g front- and back page. You can see the final finished piece below or (hopefully) on your desk right now.</p> <div class="div"></div> <div class="printed-thing"> <div class="contain"> <img src="/../img/final/printed6-lq.jpg" data-src="/../img/final/printed6.jpg" alt="My university portfolio" class="fade wait lazy lazyload" /> </div> <div class="contain"> <img src="/../img/final/printed3-lq.jpg" data-src="/../img/final/printed3.jpg" alt="My university portfolio" class="fade wait lazy lazyload" /> </div> <div class="contain"> <img src="/../img/final/printed5-lq.jpg" data-src="/../img/final/printed5.jpg" alt="My university portfolio" class="fade wait lazy lazyload" /> </div> <div class="contain"> <img src="/../img/final/printed4-lq.jpg" data-src="/../img/final/printed4.jpg" alt="My university portfolio" class="fade wait lazy lazyload" /> </div> <div class="grid final-grid"> <div class="col-50"> <img src="/../img/final/printed8-lq.jpg" data-src="/../img/final/printed8.jpg" alt="My university portfolio" class="fade wait lazy lazyload" /> </div> <div class="col-50"> <img src="/../img/final/printed7-lq.jpg" data-src="/../img/final/printed7.jpg" alt="My university portfolio" class="fade wait lazy lazyload" /> </div> </div> <div class="contain"> <img src="/../img/final/printed10-lq.jpg" data-src="/../img/final/printed10.jpg" alt="My university portfolio" class="fade wait lazy lazyload" /> </div> </div> <div class="div"></div> <h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2> <p>I’m generally very pleased with the outcome, it looks clean and feels professional to the touch, and showcases the type of work I want to do in the future; simple solutions to complex problems.</p> <p class="pull">If I were to continue working on this project, or ever do a similar project again, I would like to explore different types of paper and further enhance the colour profile. I noticed a few under-exposed pictures (compared to how I wanted them to look), which could have been improved given more experience with the print medium. As for the paper, I would have liked to try a matte option.<span>The portfolio can also be seen as a <a href="/../img/final/print.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a></span></p> <p>Ultimately, I’m extremely excited to have a physical product to hold in my hands at this point, and I hope it’s able to showcase the amount of work and effort it took to finally get there. I would also like to show my gratitude for my work placement and their continous advice and help along the way.</p> <p class="mid"> <a href="/final" class="button shift"> <svg class="icon icon-chevron-thin-left"> <use xlink:href="#icon-chevron-thin-left"></use> </svg> Back to home </a> </p> </article> <footer class="footer"> <ul class="footer-list"> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://twitter.com/MagnusSkare" target="_blank">Twitter</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://dribbble.com/PartCoffee/" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/" target="_blank">GithHub</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://instagram.com/magnusskare/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> </li> <li class="footer-links"> <a href="https://github.com/partcoffee/uni/" target="_blank">Powered by coffee and love</a> </li> </ul> </footer> <script src='https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js'></script> <script src='/js/main.js'></script> </div> <!-- Adds a warning-message for IE9 and below to encourage the user of modern browsers --> <!--[if lt IE 9]> <style>#ie-upgrade{background:#FFF;bottom:0;display:table;height:100%;left:0;position:fixed;right:0;top:0;width:100%;z-index:9000;}#ie-only{margin-bottom: 0;}.ie-message{display:table-cell;text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;padding: 0 20%;}.ie-message p{max-width:500px;margin:20px auto 30px;}#ie-upgrade .btn{display:inline-block;background:#555;color:#FFF;padding:9px 20px 8px;font-family:'proxima-nova','Helvetica','Arial',sans-serif;}</style> <div id="ie-upgrade"> <div class="ie-message"> <h1>Hello Internet Explorer user</h1> <p>Your current Internet browser is being outphased, and is too old to display this page correctly.
